Ansible runs each task in parallel across all hosts.
Ansible waits until all hosts have completed a task before moving to thenext task.
Ansible runs the tasks in the order that you specify them.

Ansible is push based: 
you: make changes to a playbook
you: run the playbook
ansible: connect to hosts to execute the module, which changes the target hosts
