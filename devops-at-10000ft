configuration management(CM) vs provisioning vs deployment

1. CM: Per https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/why-configuration-management-and-provisioning-are-different: "Configuration management tools are used to repeatably
and consistently manage the configuration of systems and the services that they provide entirely through code. Many of them achieve this in three ways: an intuitive
command line interface, a lightweight and easily-readable domain-specific language (DSL) and a comprehensive REST-based API that lowers the barrier-to-entry for
integrations with other tools. Chef, Ansible, Puppet and SaltStack are popular, open-source examples of these tools.
CM used to be repeated tasks which are applied existing systems. You have to know what is current status of the system to apply new changes to get your target. 

2. Provisioning: with tasks focusing on infrastructure, get computers or virtuals hosts to use and install needed libraries or services, etc. You care more about what
your target is, while provisioning tools like terraform will help you to get to what you want, its state management part keeps current state of the system. 

3. Deployment: the process of putting a new application or newer version of an application, onto a prepared application server.
